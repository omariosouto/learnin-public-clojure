# Editor Tips


## What editor to use?

You can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), there's a plugin called [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) but I didn't do so much tests in it.

In my daily work I'm actually using the [IntelliJ Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download/)

## How to have a better experience codding in IntelliJ?

### Install Cursive
